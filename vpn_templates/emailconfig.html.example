Hello,

we have created a newâ€‚Private Space key for a device "[(${user.device})]".

Please follow this link to download it:

[(${vpn_link})]

Please note this is one-time download link. Once used, it's disabled to prevent its misuse.
If the link does not work, and it's the first time you tried it, inform your administrator straightaway so she/he can revoke the key.

Best regards,

EnigmaBridge Private Space
