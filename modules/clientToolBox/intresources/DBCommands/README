Each subdirectory to this directory contains the configuration for a database type.
The name of this database is fetched from database.properties in the EJBCA configuration directory.

In each of the subdirectories there is a 'config.properties' file.
This file defines management commands for the database.


Each command has keys in the 'config.properties' file with the name of the command followed by a suffix. These
are the suffixes and the meaning of them:
'_command' defines a command where the command name is the string before the '_'.
'_resource_input_name' defines a resource in the same directory to be used as input to the command.
'_password' tells that the command will ask for a password. The value will be the prompt.
'_output_gzip' tells that the output should be gzipped and stored in a file. The file name should be given by the user as an argument. The value is a description of the file to be used when showing the syntax pf the argument.
'_input_gzip' same as the former but for output.


Both the '_command' string and the contents of '_resource_input_name' are parsed. The strings ${xxx} are replaced with a value from the database.properties file.
xxx could be any key in the database.properties file or a some or a part from the database URL (the database.url key).
The keys for the URL parts are the following:
'url.port' the port to connect to
'url.host' the name of the host
'url.path' the name of the database to use
'url.authority'
'url.fragment'
'url.query'
'url.scheme'
'url.userinfo'

If the user is prompted for password the 'password' key are also parsed with the submitted password.
