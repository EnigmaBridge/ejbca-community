The clientToolBox contains different tools that is used to control and test EJBCA without any direct calls to the application server on which EJBCA is running.
It is also used to generate and test keys in HSMs that will be used by an EJBCA installation.

To build the tool just go to EJBCA home and do:
ant clientToolBox

The building will produce the "dist/clientToolBox" directory.

All tools in the box is listed by a call with no arguments to "ejbcaClientToolBox.sh" in this directory.
Then just give any of the tools as argument and then you will get further instructions about this tool.

The toolbox may be used from any directory (you don't have to be in dist/clientToolBox when starting it).
You could put dist/clientToolBox in the PATH if you just want write "ejbcaClientToolBox.sh" when using a tool.

The EjbcaWsRaCli tool needs a file named ejbcawsracli.properties in the current directory when started. Just copy the file with the same name from dist/clientToolBox to you directory and modify it after your needs.
