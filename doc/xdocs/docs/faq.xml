     <question>
      Timeouts and errors during 'ant deploy' with EJBCA 6+ and JBoss 7 / EAP 6.
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>
      Ensure JBoss 7 / EAP 6 has enough cores (more than one), enough CPU (otherwise timeouts will occur) and enough memory (will also slow down the system).
      </p><p> 
The current installation procedures for JBoss 7 / EAP 6 uses the JBoss CLI to configure the application server. 
The JBoss CLI turns out not to be too well suited for automated deploys, so functions can break. For example if the machine has too few cores CLI connections will mysteriously terminate and report errors.
<br/>Contributions to improve the automated installation on JBoss 7 / EAP 6 are welcome.

    <faq id="jboss600">
     <question>
      I get an error during installation on JBoss 5, 6 or 7 using Oracle JDK (JCE cannot authenticate the provider BC).
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>Note that if you are using EJBCA 6.1 with JBoss 7, you should not encounter this issue as it was worked around in <a href="https://jira.primekey.se/browse/ECA-3371">ECA-3371</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
      For older versions this answer still applies:<br/>
      This is because JBoss 5, 6 and 7 have a bug using security providers with Oracle JDK. See JBoss issue <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBAS-7882">JBAS-7882</a>.
      </p><p>Everything works fine using OpenJDK, such as the one included with RedHat or Ubuntu servers. 
      <br/>The way to work around this is different on JBoss 5 and JBoss 7.</p>
      <p>On JBoss 6 with Oracle JDK copy ejbca/lib/bc*.jar to $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext, and remove lib/bc*.jar from the deployed ejbca.ear file. If you are unsure about this workaround
      (and the implications it has for upgrades) we suggest using JBoss 5.1.0 instead, where there is a simpler workaround.
      </p>
      <p>On JBoss 5.1 with Oracle JDK copy ejbca/lib/bc*.jar to $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/lib. Don't forget this when you upgrade EJBCA.
      </p>
      <p>On JBoss 7 you may be able to install the BC libraries as modules. See description in the JBAS-7882 issue linked above.</p>

    <faq id="illegalKeyLength">
     <question>
      I get an error with "Illegal key length" when using EJBCA.
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>
      This is because you have not installed the "Unlimited Strength Crypto Policy Files" in the Oracle JDK.
      See the <a href="installation.html#Quick%20start%20guide">prerequisites</a> section in the the installation guide.
      <br/>Even if you think you have installed them, you have not. This error is simple and unique.

      Does EJBCA support Netscape certificate extensions?
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>
      Yes through custom extensions, see admin guide and src/java/certextensions.properties for details. These extensions are old and should not be used. There are no common clients that needs them anymore and it is almost certain to cause you more trouble than they solve. Please don't use them.

      <p>
      Yes some through the Admin GUI and others through custom extensions, see Admin Guide, certificate profiles and src/java/certextensions.properties for details. many MS extended key usages are supported and all common (all we know at least) windows functions using certificates works with EJBCA certificates.

    <faq id="heapSpaceError">
     <question>
      I get an error with "Java heap space" when building EJBCA (during ant deploy).
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>
      The error should be something like:<br/>
      /usr/local/ejbca_3_6_b1/compile.xmli:239: Java heap space
      </p>
      <p>
      This error is because the default maximum allowed memory allocation for Java is too low.
      <br/>Do this in unixes:
      </p>
      <source>
      export ANT_OPTS=-Xmx=512m
      ant deploy
      </source>
      <p>On windows set the environment variable ANT_OPTS to -Xmx=512m, and restart your shell.
      </p>

      I get strange errors during 'ant deploy' or 'ant install'.
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>
      This is most usually due to a database configuration error. In the server log (JBOSS_HOME/server/default/log/server.log)
      you will probably see some SQLException errors. You should then:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>Make sure the settings in conf/database.properties are correct</li>
      <li>Follow the guidelines from "My installation failed for some reason that is now fixed, how do I proceed?"</li>

      <answer>
      <p>
      You probably have ant pre-installed as a package from Fedora or Suse. Those pre-installations does not contain all default ant 
      modules. You need the "optional tasks" included in the official ant distribution. 
      Either add modules to the installed ant, or download the latest ant from http://ant.apache.org/.
      </p>
      <p>
      A simple fix is to change the /etc/ant.conf to point to your user installed ant (in /your/ant/home). Change from:
      </p>
      <pre>
#
# ant.conf (Ant 1.6.x)
# JPackage Project (http://www.jpackage.org/)
#

# Validate --noconfig setting in case being invoked
# from pre Ant 1.6.x environment
if [ -z "$no_config" ] ; then
  no_config=true
fi

# Setup ant configuration
if $no_config ; then
  # Disable RPM layout
  rpm_mode=false
else
  # Use RPM layout
  rpm_mode=true

  # ANT_HOME for rpm layout
  ANT_HOME=/usr/share/ant
fi
      </pre>
      <p>
      to this
      </p>
      <pre>
#
# ant.conf (Ant 1.6.x)
# JPackage Project (http://www.jpackage.org/)
#

# Validate --noconfig setting in case being invoked

  # ANT_HOME for rpm layout
  ANT_HOME=/your/ant/home
fi

     <question>
      SHA256 certs fails integrity check in IE.
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>
      Internet Explorer (at least IE6) does not support SHA256. Windows Vista and later should support SHA256, but not Windows XP before SP3.

    <faq id="Unique subject DN">
     <question>
      An error that a user can not have the same Subject DN as another user appears when issuing certificates.
      </question>
      <answer>
      <p>
      Since EJBCA 3.10 different end entities can not, by default, have the same subject DN issued from one CA. This is to enforces subject DN uniqueness. In some cases this is not convenient because one user can appear as multiple end entities. 
      </p>
      <p>
      You can enable/disable this function in the "Edit Certificate Authorities" screen in the Admin GUI. In the CA configuration uncheck 'Enforce unique DN'.

	  <question>
	  I get an exception with an SQL error like "Value too large for column USERDATA.SUBJECTALTNAME" (or SUBJECTDN) when adding a new user.
	  </question>
  	  <answer>
	  <p>
	  This can happen if you have specified  one or more fields of the "Subject Alternative Name" with a total length exceeding 255 characters.
	  To avoid this problem you can safely extend the size of the column SUBJECTALTNAME and SUBJECTDN of the table USERDATA and SUBJECTDN of CERTIFICATEDATA.
	  </p>
	  <p>An example for extending the subjectDN and altName columns in MySQL (version > 5.0.3) is;</p>

    <faq id="PKCS10DNIgnored">
      <question>Enroll manually for a server - why are my PKCS10  DN fields Ignored?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
		PKCS#10 is a standard format for sending the public key (self signed
		to provide proof-of-possession) to a CA.
        </p><p>
		EJBCA does not trust the DN parts the user enters when he creates the
		PKCS10 request.
		The only way to match the certificate with what you enter in the
		pkcs10 is to enter the same thing in the end entity in EJBCA.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you really trust your RAs that send certificate requests, there is an option "Allow DN Override" in Certificate Profiles that can be used.
		This is described more in detail in the docs.</p>

      <question>How do I configure log level in JBoss?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
        jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf/jboss-log4j.xml. It is a good idea to limit the log level to not include debug logs. You can do this by changing the root category towards the end of jboss-log4j.xml:
        </p>
<source>
&lt;root&gt;
  &lt;priority value="ERROR" /&gt;
  &lt;appender-ref ref="CONSOLE"/&gt;
  &lt;appender-ref ref="FILE"/&gt;
&lt;/root> 
</source>
<p>
You may also choose to remove the CONSOLE logging completely.
</p>
<p>
You can also add this to limit the EJBCA logging to INFO, this will enable the logging system to avoid formatting
debug messages that will not be printed, enhancing performance some.
</p>
<source>
&lt;category name="org.ejbca"&gt;
   &lt;priority value="INFO"/&gt;
&lt;/category&gt;
</source>
<p>
You can here enable DEBUG logging for EJBCA by changing INFO to DEBUG. By doing all of the above (and playing around a little) 
you can get nice logging with only the things you are interested in logged to the log file.
</p>
<p>For JBoss 6 you configure the log level in the file described in the previous FAQ entry.</p>

        <b>1)</b> Make sure you have imported to correct superadmin.p12 in your browser.

	Perhaps the JBoss/Tomcat configuration was not done automatically because you are running another configuration than 'default'
	in JBoss. the file 'jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/<i>default</i>/deploy/jbossweb.sar/server.xml' holds the Tomcat configuration.

A : Shut down JBoss.
Alternative 1:
If you want to simply drop a table, go into the file JBOSS_HOME\server\default\db\hypersonic\default.script and delete the lines that creates the table, for instance to delete the table GLOBALCONFIGURATIONDATA, delete the lines :
</p><source>
CREATE TABLE GLOBALCONFIGURATIONDATA(CONFIGURATIONID VARCHAR NOT NULL,DATA VARBINARY,UNIQUE(CONFIGURATIONID))
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX PK_GLOBALCONFIGURATIONDATA ON GLOBALCONFIGURATIONDATA(CONFIGURATIONID)
</source>
<p>
Just for fun you can also delete all lines beginning with: INSERT GLOBALCONFIGURATIONDATA...

Alternative 2:
Go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/jmx-console/">http://localhost:8080/jmx-console/</a>.
Click "database=localDB,service=Hypersonic" and then startDatabaseManager: "Invoke".
This will fire up a rudimentary database interface. Only works on the same machine though.

    <faq id="createKeystore">
      <question>How do I make a keystore using keytool with a real certificate from EJBCA?</question>

# First generate a new keystore and a keypair:
keytool -genkey -alias mykey -keystore myks.jks -keyalg RSA -dname c=SE,O=AnaTom,CN=Test -keypass foo123 -storepass foo123
# You SUN keystore is now in the file 'myks.jks'. 
# Next generate a certification request (PKCS10):
keytool -certreq -alias mykey -sigalg SHA1WithRSA -file myreq.p10 -keypass foo123 -keystore myks.jks -storepass foo123
</source>

You now have the certification request in the file 'myreq.p10'.

Open up EJBCA request page in your favorite browser, 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/ejbca', and select the link for NOT having a browser'

Download the Root CA certificate by clicking on the link. Save the certificate as 'ca.pem'.

Enter the username and password of a valid user with status NEW, see question 'Why do I get the exception/error:' above. Copy and paste the contents of the certification request, 'myreq.p10' into the text field.
Save the returned certificate as 'cert.pem'.

# Import the Root CA certificate into the keystore 'myks.jks':
keytool -import -alias cacert -file ca.pem -keystore myks.jks -storepass foo123
# Import the certificate reply into the keystore:
keytool -import -alias mykey -file cert.pem -keystore myks.jks -storepass foo123 -keypass foo123
# Now you can take a look at your SUN keystore with:
keytool -list -keystore myks.jks

<p>
In theory, you can use the same method with a BouncyCastle PKCS12 keystore by adding the following
arguments to every command above:
</p>
<source>
-provider org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider -storetype PKCS12 -providerpath $EJBCA_HOME/lib/bcprov-jdk15on-151.jar
</source>
<p>
unforturnately a bug in keytool prevents this from functioning properly at the moment, therefore I
recommend using the 'bin/ejbca.sh ca' to create PKCS12 keystores. It can be used to create keystores generally,
not just for CAs.

  <faq id="exportClassification">
      <question>What is EJBCA's export classification in the United States of America?</question>
	  <answer>
	    <p>
	    At the time of writing (26 Feb 2008) EJBCA is approved classified under ECCN code 5D002 and approved for export under License Exception TSU. 
	    See The <a href="http://www.bis.doc.gov/licensing/exportingbasics.htm">Bureau of Industry and Security website</a> for further details.<br/>
	    EJBCA actually has the same classification as the Bouncy Castle JCE provider, from which this FAQ text is a rip-off. Thanks BC!

  <faq id="passwordEE">
      <question>When a new end entity is created, where and how is the password stored?</question>
	  <answer>
	    <p>
		A one-time password is stored hashed with BCrypt in the UserData table
		in the database. If the checkbox 'clear text password' is checked when
		adding the user the password is stored in clear text, to be used for
		server side generation.

  <faq id="caKeyStorage">
      <question>Where are software based CA keys stored in the database?</question>
	  <answer>
	    <p>
		These keys are stored in a PKCS#12 file, encrypted with a password.
		The PKCS#12 is stored in the database in the CAData table.

  <faq id="keyRecoveryStorage">
      <question>If I enable key recovery, where are the end entities private keys stored in the database?</question>
	  <answer>
	    <p>
		The private keys for key recovery is stored in the KeyRecoveryData
		table in the database. The data is encrypted with the CAs encryption
		key. The private keys are only stored if key recovery is enabled.

  <faq id="glassfishFail1">
  <question>Glassfish issue no. 1: ant install fails with some weird errors.</question>
  <answer>
  <p>
  This issue affects Glassfishv2 Enterprise Edition (open source admin console is slightly different and doesn't have this features).
If you are experiencing errors when doing <i>ant install</i>, do the following:
<ul>
<li>Open up glassfish admin console in your browser (https://&lt;host-name>:4848/)</li>
<li>On the left hand side, expand Stand-Alone Instances node</li>
<li>Click on the server (Admin Server)</li>
<li>In the righ-hand broswer frame, click JNDI browsing button.</li>
<li>You should get Jndi tree browsing window.</li>
<li>Expand the jdbc node.</li>
<li>Make sure that jdbc/EjbcaDS exists.</li>
<li>If it exists, than this issue in not the cause for your “ant install” failure.</li>
<li>If it doesn't exist, do the following:</li>
<li>In the glassfish admin console, remove the EjbcaPool created earlier and remove data source jdbc/EjbcaDS.</li>
<li>Start EJBCA build from scratch with ant clean etc.</li>
</ul>
</p>

  <faq id="GlassfishFail2">
  <question>Glassfish issue no. 2: ant install fails with some weird errors</question>
  <answer>
  <p>
This issue affects both Glassfishv2 Enterprise Edition and Glasfish v2 open source edition.
If you notice messages such as "database open for read only access", you have started glassfish with insufficient privileges. Stop the domain and restart it with privileges of the user who has full rights for glassfish.
