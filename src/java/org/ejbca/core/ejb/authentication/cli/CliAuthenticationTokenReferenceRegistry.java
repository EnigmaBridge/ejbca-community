/**
 * Due to being sent over remote, this token needs to protect against two threats: replay and interception.
 * 
 * Replay is stopped via the CliAuthenticationTokenReferenceRegistry, where each authentication token must register prior to its first authorization.
 * Once authorized the token is removed from that registry, and further attempts to authorize the same token will fail. In order to allow the same
 * token to be used several times within the local environment, the transient 'isVerified'-flag is set upon the first authorization.
 * 
 * Interception of this token being transmitted risks making the password hash known, which can be used to forge future tokens. To guard against this
 * threat, the password hash is never transmitted in cleartext. Instead a SHA1 hash is calculated on server side, registered here but not transmitted
 * back (see CliAuthenticationToken's clone method). Meanwhile, on the client side the SHA1 hash is recalculated and stored in the token, and at
 * authorization the two are compared to make sure that the token is valid. Note that this implies that true athentication (password comparison) is
 * not performed until the first authorization act.
