WebApp EJBCA Plugin Demo - EJBCA 5.X
====================================

This sample plugin installs a webapp at the URL: http://localhost:8080/ejbca/pluginweb

The web apps illustrates the plugin scheme including how to access internal
EJBCA CA resources.

One of the applications extends the EJBCA database with another table and
accesses it using an entity bean, EJB3 and Hiberbate.  That is, the same
stuff that EJBCA is made of.

Note that this plugin adds a table "MyCounterData" to the EJBCA database schema.
