__debian package of Ejbca__

This package installs a prebuild ejbca with jboss as appsrv and mysql as db.
This package was introduced after 3.5.0.
It's not availible from debian.org yet, 
but there will be prebuilt packages from: http://han.pp.se/

Debian package author:
Henrik Andreasson <debian@han.pp.se>

__debian repository with prebuild ejbca & jboss4 packages__

add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list

unstable
deb http://debian.han.pp.se/debian/ unstable main
deb-src http://debian.han.pp.se/debian/ unstable main

stable
deb http://debian.han.pp.se/debian/ stable main
deb-src http://debian.han.pp.se/debian/ stable main

__Install prebuilt ejbca package__

#get my pgp key
$> gpg --recv-keys --keyserver pgpkeys.mit.edu 46E91490

#add it to trusted signers of debian packages
$> gpg -a --export 46E91490  | sudo apt-key add -

# update repository lists
$> apt-get update

# install ejbca
$> apt-get install ejbca

# now all the files is installed in:
/etc/ejbca
/usr/share/ejbca (EJBCA_HOME)


__Setup of EJBCA__

now you have two choices DIY or scripted setup

DIY:, all stuff should be in place as usual ejbca is in /usr/share/ejbca
APPSRV_HOME is /usr/share/jboss4

scripted: just run /usr/share/ejbca/ejbca-setup (it will remove old conf/db!!!!)


__ejbca package dependencies__

The package needs sun-java from debian "non-free"

Like this (add the "non-free" stanza):
deb http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian/ unstable main non-free contrib
deb-src http://ftp.se.debian.org/debian/ unstable main non-free contrib

and jboss4 (4.0.5) is build from pkg-jboss (http://wiki.debian.org/JBossPackaging)
prebuild packages it available from debian.han.pp.se as above.


__How to build the package you self__

get sources from sf release or cvs 

unpack and change dir into ejbca-x.y.z
apt-get install dpkg-dev fakeroot
cp -r src/pkg/debian .
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot
in .. there shall now be a package called ejbca_3.5.0_all.deb 
just install it with dpkg -i ejbca_3.5.0_all.deb
